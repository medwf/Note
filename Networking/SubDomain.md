A subdomain is a part of a larger domain name and is used to organize and navigate to different sections or functionalities of a website. It is a way to create a distinct web address within the main domain. Subdomains are hierarchical, meaning they are structured as part of the main domain.

In a typical domain structure, a domain consists of two main parts:

1. **Second-Level Domain (SLD):** This is the primary and chosen part of the domain name, representing the main identity of the website.

2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** This is the last part of the domain, indicating the type or purpose of the website (e.g., ".com," ".org," ".net").

A subdomain is created by adding a third-level domain to the main domain, forming a structure like this:

- subdomain.example.com

In this example:

- "example" is the second-level domain.

- "com" is the top-level domain.

- "subdomain" is the subdomain.

Subdomains are often used to organize content, services, or specific sections of a website. They can be used for various purposes, such as creating separate sections for blogs, forums, support services, or language-specific content. Each subdomain can have its own distinct content and may even be hosted on a separate server.

For example:

- Blog subdomain: blog.example.com

- Support subdomain: support.example.com

- Store subdomain: store.example.com

Subdomains are commonly set up through the domain's DNS (Domain Name System) settings, and each subdomain can be associated with a different IP address or directory on the web server, allowing for flexibility in website organization and management.
