HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. In simpler terms, it is a set of rules that govern how information is exchanged over the internet.

Key features of HTTP include:

1. **Client-Server Model:** The communication in HTTP takes place between a client (usually a web browser) and a server (where the web content is hosted). The client sends requests, and the server responds with the requested data.

2. **Statelessness:** HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request from a client to a server is independent and unrelated to previous requests. The server does not retain information about the client's state between requests.

3. **Request-Response Model:** Communication between the client and server occurs through a series of requests and responses. A client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested information or an error message.

4. **Methods (Verbs):** HTTP defines various request methods (or verbs) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include GET (retrieve a resource), POST (submit data to be processed), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), and others.

5. **Status Codes:** HTTP responses include status codes that indicate the result of the request. Common status codes include 200 OK (successful request), 404 Not Found (resource not found), 500 Internal Server Error (server error), and others.

6. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):** Resources on the web are identified using URLs. A URL specifies the location and name of a resource on the web, allowing clients to access it.

7. **Headers:** HTTP messages include headers that provide additional information about the request or response. Headers can include details such as the content type, content length, and more.

8. **Security:** While the basic HTTP is not secure, an extension called HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS protocols to provide secure communication over the internet.

HTTP is fundamental to the functioning of the World Wide Web, enabling the transfer of text, images, videos, and other multimedia content between clients and servers.
