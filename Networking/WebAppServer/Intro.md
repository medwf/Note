An application server and a web server are both crucial components of web-based applications, but they serve different purposes and handle different aspects of the web application stack.

Web Server:

A web server's primary function is to handle HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serve static content like HTML pages, images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

Examples of web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and Lite Speed.

Web servers are often used in conjunction with application servers to handle static content delivery efficiently.

Application Server:

An application server is responsible for executing the business logic of an application, handling dynamic content generation, and managing the application's components.

It provides an environment for running server-side programs or scripts and facilitates interactions between these programs and backend databases or other services.

Application servers are commonly used for processing user input, executing complex calculations, managing sessions, and other dynamic tasks.

Examples of application servers include Apache Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic.

In summary, while web servers primarily serve static content and handle HTTP requests, application servers execute the logic and processing required to generate dynamic content and manage the application's functionality. Often, modern web applications deploy both web servers and application servers to efficiently handle different aspects of serving web content.
