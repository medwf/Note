`ufw` stands for Uncomplicated Firewall, and it is a user-friendly command-line interface for managing firewall rules on Linux systems. `ufw` is designed to simplify the process of configuring and managing the built-in Net filter firewall, which is a part of the Linux kernel.

Here are some key points about `ufw`:

1.  **Simplicity**: As the name suggests, `ufw` aims to provide a straightforward and easy-to-use interface for managing firewall settings without requiring users to have an in-depth understanding of iptables, which is the traditional and more complex firewall tool on Linux.

1. **Default Rules**: By default, `ufw` denies all incoming connections and allows all outgoing connections. This default behavior ensures a secure starting point, and users can then selectively enable specific rules as needed.

1. **Command-Line Interface**: `ufw` is primarily a command-line tool, and it uses a simple syntax for creating rules. This makes it suitable for both novice and experienced users who prefer command-line interactions.

1. Install ufw enable and disable:

Sudo apt install ufw # install all incoming and outcoming bloc by default

Sudo ufw enable  # enable ufw

Sudo ufw disable # disable ufw

1. restart ufw:

Sudo ufw reset

ADDING RULE . # adding role in inactive status

- Allowing SSH traffic:

  sudo ufw allow 22

  sudo ufw allow ssh

- Allowing traffic on a specific port with a protocol (e.g., TCP):

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp ===> http

sudo ufw allow 443/tcp ==> https

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp ===> ssh

Sudo ufw deny something/tcp

# this format to allow or deny From IP address with specific port and protocol

Sudo ufw deny/allow from IP to any port PORT proto TCP

- Checking the status of the firewall:

sudo ufw status # normal status rule

sudo ufw status verbose # add default incoming and outgoing.

sudo ufw status numbered # give number of the rule

- Delete specific rule:

 sudo ufw delete <number-rule>

1. Directory config ufw:

1. /etc/default/ufw.

1. You can disable IPV6.

It's important to note that `ufw` is available on many Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu. While `ufw` provides a simplified interface, it's built on top of iptables, so it still leverages the underlying Linux Net filter framework for firewall functionality.
