Let's dive into the key differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as their syntax.

### MySQL vs. PostgreSQL

#### 1. **General Overview**
- **MySQL**: A widely-used, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that’s known for its speed and reliability. It's often used in web applications, especially with PHP.
- **PostgreSQL**: Another powerful, open-source RDBMS, but it's known for its advanced features and standards compliance. It supports more complex operations and is very extensible.

#### 2. **Performance**
- **MySQL**: Typically faster for read-heavy operations.
- **PostgreSQL**: Optimized for complex queries and large write operations.

#### 3. **Features**

- **MySQL**:
  - Simpler, easier to set up.
  - Limited support for advanced features like table inheritance and custom data types.
- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Rich feature set including support for JSON, XML, and custom data types.
  - Advanced indexing techniques (e.g., GiST, GIN, and full-text search).

#### 4. **Standards Compliance**
- **MySQL**: More lenient with SQL standards; prioritizes speed and ease of use.
- **PostgreSQL**: Strict adherence to SQL standards, ensuring robust and reliable data handling.

### Syntax Differences

#### Creating a Database

- **MySQL**:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE dbname;
  ```

- **PostgreSQL**:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE dbname;
  ```

#### Creating a Table

- **MySQL**:

  ```sql

  CREATE TABLE tablename (

      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

      name VARCHAR(100)

  );

  ```

- **PostgreSQL**:

  ```sql

  CREATE TABLE tablename (

      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

      name VARCHAR(100)

  );

  ```

#### Inserting Data

- **MySQL**:

  ```sql

  INSERT INTO tablename (name) VALUES ('example');

  ```

- **PostgreSQL**:

  ```sql

  INSERT INTO tablename (name) VALUES ('example');

  ```

#### Selecting Data

- **MySQL**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tablename;
  ```

- **PostgreSQL**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tablename;
  ```

Though their syntax is quite similar in basic operations, PostgreSQL offers more advanced capabilities in terms of custom data types and complex queries.
