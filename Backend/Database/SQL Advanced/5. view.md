- a view is a fake table that list data with some condition and it is always UpToDate.
## Example I

- WHERE (last meeting is NULL or last then 1 month) AND score < 80
``` SQL
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS need_meeting;
CREATE VIEW need_meeting AS
SELECT name FROM students
WHERE score < 80 AND
(
    last_meeting IS NULL OR
    last_meeting < SUBDATE(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
);
```
