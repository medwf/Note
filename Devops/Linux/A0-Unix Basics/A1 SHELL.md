# What is Shell ?
- A `shell` is a special user program that `provides` an `interface for the user` to use `operating system` services. Shell accepts `human-readable commands` from users and `converts them` into something which the `kernel can understand`.
- It is a `command language interpreter` that `executes commands` read `from input devices such as keyboards` or `from files`. The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.

## Shell Category:

###  Command Line Shell (CLIs)
- Shell can be accessed by users using a `command line interface`. A special program called `Terminal` in Linux/macOS, or Command Prompt in Windows OS is `provided` to type in the `human-readable commands` such as “cat”, “ls” etc. and then it is being executed. The result is then displayed on the terminal to the user. 

### Graphical Shells (GUIs)

- Graphical shells provide means for manipulating programs based on the graphical user interface (GUI), by allowing for operations such as opening, closing, moving, and resizing windows, as well as switching focus between windows. Window OS or Ubuntu OS can be considered as a good example which provides GUI to the user for interacting with the program. Users do not need to type in commands for every action.

- There are several shells are available for Linux systems like:

	- BASH (Bourne Again SHell) – It is the most widely used shell in Linux systems. It is used as default login shell in Linux systems and in macOS. It can also be installed on Windows OS.
	- CSH (C SHell) – The C shell’s syntax and its usage are very similar to the C programming language.
	- KSH (Korn SHell) – The Korn Shell was also the base for the POSIX Shell standard specifications etc.

- Each shell does the same job but understands different commands and provides different built-in functions.

# Terminal
- it's a program called a terminal emulator, this is a program that open a windows and let user interact with the shell. 
- `#` : root or call super user.
- `$` : user.
