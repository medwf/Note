# What is Webpack:
- **bundle** : 
	- it is a file that contains all the modules your application.
- **Webpack**: 
	- it is a tool that lets you compile JavaScript modules, also known as module bundler.
	- given a large number of files, it generates a single file or (`few file`) that run your app.
	- does not run during your page, it's runs during your development.
-  **dependency Graph**:
	- Any time one file depends on another
	- webpack treats this as a dependency.
	- also provide them as dependencies for your applications.

## Webpack core Concepts ? 
- **Entry \[ ]:** 
	- the file should start with. you can have one `main.js` or many.
	- as default is `src/index.js` : you can modify by create config file and change value.
- **Output \[ ] :**
	- where webpack should create new compile file. `path`, `file`
- **Loaders \[ ] :**
	- webpack only understand JavaScript and Json files.
	- loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid Modules that can be consumed by your application. (`'jpg .img ...`).
	- in `modules ... rules`:
		- `test`: have a regex to all file should be transforming.
		- `use`: which loader should be use to that test to do transforming.
- **Plugins \[ ]**
	- can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like:
		- bundle optimization.
		- assert management
		- injection of environment.
- **Mode \[ ]**
	- make condition in environment.
## Webpack modules ?
- In contrast to [Node.js modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html), webpack _modules_ can express their _dependencies_ in a variety of ways. A few examples are:
	- An [ES2015 `import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) statement
	- A [CommonJS](https://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) `require()` statement
	- An [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md) `define` and `require` statement
	- An [`@import` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import) inside of a css/sass/less file.
	- An image url in a stylesheet `url(...)` or HTML `<img src=...>` file.
### Supported Module Types
- Webpack supports the following module types natively:
	- [ECMAScript modules](https://webpack.js.org/guides/ecma-script-modules)
	- CommonJS modules
	- AMD modules
	- [Assets](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules)
	- WebAssembly modules
### Module Resolution:
- A resolver a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path.
	- `import someThning from '/path/to/module';`.
	- `require('path/to/module');`
### Code splitting ?


## How to setup Webpack for a basic project ?
1. `npm init -y` : create basic package.json
2. `npm install webpack --save-dev` : install webpack.
3. Create basic javascript File:
	1. `touch index.js`: this will be your main entry point.
	2. `echo "console.log('hello from webpack!') > index.js"`
4. Create config file for webpack:
	1. `touch webpack.config.js` : create config webpack file. 
	2. add this config to that file:
``` js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
	entry: './index.js', // Your entry point 
	output: { filename: 'bundle.js', // Name of the output bundle
	path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
	},
};```

3. This configuration specifies:
	1. `entry`: The starting point for Webpack (`index.js file`).
	2. `output`: 
		1. `filename`: The name of the bundled file (`bundle.js `).
		2. `path`: the directory where Webpack will place the bundle file (`dist`).

4. create script to run Webpack (Optional):
	1. in `package.json` add :
``` JSON
{
	"scripts": {
		"build": "webpack"
	}
}
``` 
5. Running Webpack and Viewing the Output:
	1. `npm run build`: now you can run webpack and create bundled file.
	2.  Webpack will process your code and create a bundled file (`bundle.js`) in the `dist` directory.
	3. You won't see any output directly, as the bundled code is meant to be included in an HTML file.
6. Including the Bundle in an HTML File (optional):
	1.  Create an HTML file named `index.html` in your project directory.
	    
	- Add an `<script>` tag to the HTML file, referencing the bundled JavaScript file:
	    ``` HTML
	    <!DOCTYPE html>
	    <html>
	      <head>
	        <title>Webpack Example</title>
	      </head>
	      <body>
	        <h1>Hello from a Webpack Bundle!</h1>
	        <script src="./dist/bundle.js"></script>
	      </body>
	    </html>
	    ```
	- Open `index.html` in your browser. The console should now log "Hello from Webpack!". This confirms that Webpack has successfully bundled your JavaScript code.
7. **Additional Considerations:** : 
	- For more complex projects, you might explore Webpack loaders to handle various file types (e.g., CSS, images).
	- Webpack offers a rich plugin ecosystem for tasks like code splitting, minification, and hot reloading. Refer to the official Webpack documentation for in-depth configuration options: [https://webpack.js.org/](https://webpack.js.org/)
