- virtualization software
- make `developing` and `deploying` application much easier
- `packages application` with all necessary dependencies, configuration, system tools and runtime
- easily share and distributed
- size MB large because it work just on app layer
# What docker problems solved ?
**Problems:**
- Each `developer` needs to `install` and `configure` all services directly in their OS on their local machine. 
- installation process different for each OS environment.
- `Many steps`, where something go `wrong`.
- if your `app` uses `10 services`, each developer needs to `install these 10 services`.

**Solves :**
- Own isolated environment.
- database packaged with all dependencies and config.
- each developer don't need to setup services from scratch. 
- start a service as a Docker container using a 1 Docker command.
- docker container command same for all OS
- docker container command same for all services
- easy to run different versions of same app without any conflicts `Redis v3.5 v3.6 v3.7`

# Deployment process ?
**Before :**
- developer have app to operations to install it in server that make conflicts `you now that!`
- Misconnections between developers and operations.
	- Human errors can happen
	- Back and forth communication

**After :**
- Onetime effort  `install docker in server`
- Docker artifact includes everything the app needs
- Everything is packaged inside the Docker artifact 
- Operator No configuration 

# Docker Images vs Container ? 
**Image :**
- an executable application artifact.
- include app source, but also complete environment configuration
- have application `JS APP`, services `node, npm` , OS layer `linux`
- add environment variables. create directory, files, etc.

**Container :**
- running instance of image is a container. 
- for one image you can run multi container.

# Docker Registries:
- A storage and distribution system for Docker images.
- `Official images` available from application like Redis, mongo, mysql. ... 
- `Official images` are maintained by the software authors or in collaboration with the Docker community.
- Docker `hosts` one of `biggest` `Docker registry` call  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

# Privet docker Image
