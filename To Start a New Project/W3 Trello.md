What’s the Trello board?

[Trello](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/nHPXY_uuCJ8h-diK1DoyJw) is a free project management software that uses a [kanban board](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/WBoV3Vg98rcrkt2AIa524w) to visually track the implementation of a feature set from “to-do” to “done”. Trello makes it easy to assign tasks, collaborate and collect notes in a central location.

There are other project management tools, such as [Asana](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/S1G-qZegtNVp9_MI39zXow), [Airtable](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Q8gCI02YehO3Z_vWdDvllg), and [Jira](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Vx-2zvCZYFhArPb1v4X7aQ). Trello has been selected for ease of use and ability to visualize progress.
