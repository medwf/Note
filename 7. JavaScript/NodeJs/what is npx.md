npx stands for **Node Package Execute**. It's a tool included with npm (Node Package Manager) since npm version 5.2.0. Here's what npx does and how it can be useful:

- **Run Packages Without Installation:** Unlike npm which installs packages, npx lets you execute them directly without any prior installation. This is particularly helpful for one-time use cases or trying out a package before committing to installing it globally or locally in your project.
    
- **Avoids Versioning Issues:** Managing multiple Node.js versions and their corresponding package versions can be tricky. npx takes care of this by fetching the necessary package version on the fly and running it. This ensures you're using the correct version for the task at hand.
    
- **Executes Package Binaries:** Many npm packages come with executable files (binaries) that provide specific functionalities. npx allows you to directly run these binaries without needing to remember their installation paths or locations within the `node_modules` folder.
    

**How to Use npx:**

Using npx is straightforward. You simply prefix the package name you want to run with `npx`. Here are some examples:

- **Create a React project:** Instead of installing `create-react-app` globally, you can use:
    ```
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```
    
- **Run a linter:** Imagine you want to use ESLint to check code style in a project that doesn't have ESLint installed. You can use:
    
    ```
    npx eslint my-file.js
    ```
    
- **Use a package binary:** If a package provides a binary named `my-tool`, you can run it with:
    
    ```
    npx my-package-name my-tool arguments
    ```
    

**Here are some things to keep in mind with npx:**

- While convenient, npx doesn't install the package globally or locally. The downloaded package is cached and used temporarily.
- If you need the package for ongoing use within your project, it's generally recommended to install it using `npm install <package-name>`.
- Be cautious with typos, as npx will attempt to download and run the exact package name you provide.

Overall, npx is a handy tool for developers to streamline their workflow by running Node.js packages without needing permanent installations.
