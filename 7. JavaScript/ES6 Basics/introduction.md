# What is JavaScript ?

- JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
- ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
- ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
- Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).
