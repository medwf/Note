###  ways to make this requests in Node and how we can handle errors.
- HTTP requests is all about transferring data over a network which is built on a [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model).
- The underlying technology is the `HTTP` (`Hypertext Transfer Protocol`) which is used to structure requests and responses over the Internet. It was originally designed to `allow communication between web servers and web browsers` with just sending html but its protocol is now used hugely for a variety of purposes. Well, our focus in this article is `HTTP requests` which is the protocol where a piece of data is requested from a server.
-  **The HTTP requests contains `Three Elements` which includes:**
	1. The `request method` which I called the components earlier.
	1. The `target`, where the request is going to. This is usually the `URL`.
	2. The protocol name and its version.
	
- **Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc)** : make a request with one of those methods.
- **Sending data**: make post request to send data to server.
- **Headers**: Headers are what I call `additional information` or `metadata` that is sent alongside the request. They do not also work with the request but with the response as well. Inasmuch as it sounds like it is less used, it is still very much needed to provide information about the subject of the request.
- **Authentication** :  We still have to call this a request component even if we can use it or do what it does on the Headers or as a Data. More often `you will be sending a token to the server` so the server can authenticate and know who you are before giving you access to the resource.
# HTTP request in Node:
## `https` module:
- This is a built in standard library or module that is basically used to build a HTTP client and server.
```JAVASCRIPT
// make get request using HTTPS it is same why as http.
const https = require("https");
https
	.get(`https://reqres.in/api/users`, resp => {
		let data = "";
		
		// A chunk of data has been recieved.
		resp.on("data", chunk => {
			data += chunk;
		}); 
	
		// The whole response has been received. Print out the result.
		resp.on("end", () => {
			let url = JSON.parse(data).message;
			console.log(url);
		});
	})
	.on("error", err => {
		console.log("Error: " + err.message);
});

// make post request using HTTPS.
// that not working for me.
const https = require("https");
const options = {
  hostname: 'yourapi.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/todos',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': data.length
  }
}
https
  .request(options, resp => {
    // log the data
    resp.on("data", d => {
      process.stdout.write(d);
    });
  })
  .on("error", err => {
    console.log("Error: " + err.message);
  });
```
## `Axios` promised-based HTTP client
- GET request.
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// it is works localy GET request :).
// install npm axios ...
const axios = require('axios').default;

async function getstatus() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/api/v1/status`);
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
getstatus()
```
## Using `request` module:
1. Simple request:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const request = require('request');

// error have a msg error.
// response have a response.
// body a body of of response.
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  console.error('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode);
  console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
});
```
2. 
## Using `fetch` alternatives:
