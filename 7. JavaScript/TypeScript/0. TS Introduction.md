`TypeScript` stands in an unusual `relationship to JavaScript`. 
- TypeScript is called superscript of javascript.
- typescript force you to declare type of declaration.
- TypeScript `offers` all of `JavaScript’s features`.
- additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

For example: 
- JavaScript `provides language primitives` like `string` and `number`,
- but it doesn’t check that you’ve `consistently assigned` these. `TypeScript` does.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The `main benefit` of TypeScript is that it `can highlight unexpected behavior` in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

# Types by inference
```TS
// <var| let | const> nameVar: <type>.
// variable string.
let helloWorld = "Hello World";
     ^ let helloWorld: string

// object.
// describe this object’s shape using an interface
export interface Student {
/* normal declare */
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
  location: string;
}

// create object from Student
const studentA /* name of variable */: Student /* type: name of object */ = {
  firstName: "aaa",
  lastName: "aaaa",
  age: 22,
  location: "South Korea",
};


```
