#### How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page size parameters :

Paginating a dataset with `page` and `page_size` parameters involves splitting the data into smaller chunks and returning the relevant chunk based on user input. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Define Pagination Parameters:**

- **page:** This represents the current page number requested by the user (typically starts at 1).
- **page_size:** This defines the number of items per page (e.g., 10, 20, 50).

**2. Retrieve Data:**

- Fetch the entire dataset from your data source (database, list, etc.).

**3. Calculate Starting Index:**

- Use the following formula to calculate the starting index for the current page: `starting_index = (page - 1) * page_size`

**4. Slice the Data:**

- Use the starting index and page size to extract the relevant portion of the data using slicing notation. Here's an example for Python lists:

``` python
data_subset = data[starting_index:starting_index + page_size]
```

- This will return a list containing only the items for the requested page.

**5. (Optional) Calculate Total Pages:**

- You can calculate the total number of pages by dividing the total number of items in the dataset by the page size and rounding up:

``` python
total_pages = math.ceil(len(data) / page_size)
```

**6. Return the Paginated Data:**

- Return the data subset (`data_subset`) along with any additional information like `total_pages`, `current_page`, etc. This will allow the user interface to display the relevant page and provide navigation options.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Implement checks for invalid page numbers or page sizes to prevent errors.
- **Database Queries:** If using a database, you can leverage functionalities like `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses in your queries to retrieve paginated data efficiently. Frameworks like Django REST framework offer built-in pagination functionalities.

By following these steps, you can implement basic pagination for your dataset using `page` and `page_size` parameters.

#### How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
Hypermedia pagination offers a more flexible and discoverable approach to paginating datasets compared to simple page and page_size parameters. Here's how it works:

**1. Include Links in the Response:**

Instead of relying on explicit page and page_size parameters, your API response includes links related to navigating the dataset. These links typically reside in the response header or a dedicated section within the response body.

**2. Common Link Relations:**

Here are some commonly used link relations for hypermedia pagination:

- **`first`:** Link to the first page of the dataset.
- **`prev`:** Link to the previous page (if applicable).
- **`next`:** Link to the next page (if applicable).
- **`last`:** Link to the last page of the dataset.
- **`self`:** Link to the current page being returned.

**3. Example Response:**

Imagine a response containing 10 items out of a total of 50 (page size = 10, current page = 2):

```JSON
{
  "data": [ /* List of 10 items for page 2 */ ],
  "links": {
    "first": "https://api.example.com/data?page=1&size=10",
    "prev": "https://api.example.com/data?page=1&size=10",
    "next": "https://api.example.com/data?page=3&size=10",
    "last": "https://api.example.com/data?page=5&size=10",
    "self": "https://api.example.com/data?page=2&size=10"
  }
}
```

**4. Benefits:**

- **Discoverability:** Clients can explore the API by following the provided links, leading to a more interactive experience.
- **Flexibility:** You can define additional link relations specific to your API (e.g., links to related resources based on current data).
- **Decoupling:** Separates pagination logic from the core response data.

**5. Implementation:**

- Frameworks like [https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/) offer built-in support for hypermedia pagination.
- Libraries like [https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) can be used to define custom link relations in your response headers.

**Remember:**

- Include relevant information like total number of items alongside the links for better user experience.
- Ensure proper link construction based on current page, page size, and total data size.

By utilizing hypermedia metadata, you create a more dynamic and user-friendly way to navigate large datasets within your API.
