By now, you have picked up on the fact that ALX is serious and deliberate about community, so we’re going to spend some time helping to get you immersed in ALX Community and all of the benefits of being a member, while also helping you to be a good community member. In ALX Community Code of Conduct we call out 3 reasons that ALX has put such emphasis on community these are: * The Network * The Empowered Journey * Accountability

### 1.The Network:

Build a strong network beyond the program: By enrolling you in a program offered by ALX, we are inviting you to join our family of learners, and we expect you to behave accordingly. The learner community is a space for you to get to know new people, engage with them and learn with them. We want this community to be an asset for you even after the program concludes.

### 2. The Empowered Journey:

Community empowers you to lead your learning journey: With the internet and the availability of learning resources, you no longer need a “sage on stage” to learn new skills and concepts. You can learn almost anything online and at your own pace. We want to facilitate that transition and empower you to own your learning.

### 3. Accountability

In the community, we hold each other accountable: Solo online learning can be intimidating is extremely hard to sustain without a proper support system. We aim to create an accountability system where learners can share resources, regularly support each other, can reach out for help, and provide feedback to one another. You never need to feel alone in your learning journey.
