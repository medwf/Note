What are the steps of the Feynman Learning Technique? (Select all that apply)
    Step 1: Choose a concept you want to learn about.
    
    Once you identify a topic, take out a blank sheet of paper. Write out everything you know about the subject you want to understand as if you were teaching it to a child.
    Step 4: Organize and Review
    
    To test your understanding in the real world, run it by someone else. How effective was your explanation? What questions did they ask? What parts did they get confused about?
     Step 3: Reflect, Refine, and Simplify
    
    Only when you can explain the subject in simple terms do you understand it.
      Step 2: Explain it to a 12-year-old
    
    Now that you think you understand a topic reasonably well, explain it to a 12-year-old.

In the intro video we import the time module and use sleep, i.e. `from    time import sleep`. In a general sense, why is it important to get enough sleep and maintain good sleep hygiene? (Select all that apply)

     Good sleep can maximize problem-solving skills and enhance memory.
   
         When you sleep, new connections are made in your brain that were not there during the day and it makes you understand better
    
         Poor sleep has been shown to impair brain function.
    
         Poor sleep is linked to depression, not being able to cope with all that is coming towards us.

     I will develop and test my code myself - the checker is there to confirm the checks I have done myself.
