#focused_and_diffused Thinking ?( learning New info )
    focused Thinking :
        - works by looking at a problem set and trying really hard to get it 
        - it's about actively using every ounce of mental force  to understand the problem that is in front of us 
         - it is like seeing a brick wall and reasoning 
           "it is too hard to just run through and too tall to climb"
    Diffused Thinking :
          - just letting your mind wander without a plan it can deepen your understanding or trigger new creative thoughts  
          - your mind might say "Hey, why don't we tie a bunch of balloons together and just float over it ?"
    both processes are important to maximize your understanding of problem you facing to truly optimize your learning " play ping pong between the two FOCUS relax FOCUS relax FOCUS relax"
#The_Feynman_technique 
  - (pick a topic) you want to understand and start studying it 
  - ( write all topic )once you know what is about take about tale a piece of paper and write about it as if you are teaching the idea to someone else ( ideally write and speak at the same time just as a teacher )
  - that makes you realize which part you understand and where you still have gaps 
  - whenever  you get stuck go back to study and repeat that process until you have explained the whole topic from start to end 
  - when you are done repeat the process from the beginning but this time simplify your language or use a graphic analogy to make a point
