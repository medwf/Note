- `CSS` is not a programming language. it's not a markup language either. 
- `CSS` is **is a style sheet language**.
- `CSS` is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
# include file css to html
- use tag link.
```HTML
	<<-- you can add it in head tag -->>
	<link href="relative/path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

# Anatomy of a CSS ruleset.
- Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:
- ![[Pasted image 20240601114635.png]]
- Note the other important parts of the syntax:
	- Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. (`{}`)
	- Within each declaration, you must use a colon (`:`) to separate the property from its value or values.
	- Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (`;`) to separate each declaration from the next one.

# Selecting multiple elements:
- You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them.
- Separate multiple selectors by commas.
```CSS
p,
li,
h1 {
	color: red;
}
```

# Different types of selectors
- There are many different types of selectors:

| Selector name                                              | What does it select                                                                                              | Example                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector) | All HTML elements of the specified type.                                                                         | `p`  <br>selects `<p>`                                                                   |
| ID selector                                                | The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique.             | `#my-id`  <br>selects `<p id="my-id">` or `<a id="my-id">`                               |
| Class selector                                             | The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.  | `.my-class`  <br>selects `<p class="my-class">` and `<a class="my-class">`               |
| Attribute selector                                         | The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.                                                         | `img[src]`  <br>selects `<img src="myimage.png">` but not `<img>`                        |
| Pseudo-class selector                                      | The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) | `a:hover`  <br>selects `<a>`, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link. |

There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN [Selectors guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors).
