# What is procedures ?
- stored procedure : is prepared SQL code that you can save.
- it is a code that use often, and with procedure we can stored in nickname.
- it want to use it : `CALL nameOfprocedure();`.
``` SQL
-- create procedure.
CREATE
	[DEFINER = _user_]
	PROCEDURE _sp_name_ ([_proc_parameter_[,...]])
	[_characteristic_ ...] _routine_body_

-- delete procedure.
DROP PROCEDURE procedure_name;
```

## Example I 
- creates a stored procedure `AddBonus` that adds a new correction for a student.
``` SQL
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS AddBonus;
DELIMETERS ##
CREATE PROCEDURE AddBouns(IN user_id INT,
						  IN project_name VARCHAR(255),
						  IN score INT)
BEGIN
	DECLAIRE project_id INT;

	IF ((SELECT id FROM projects WHERE name = project_name) IS NULL) THEN
		INSERT INTO projects (name) VALUES (project_name);
	END IF;
	project_id = (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE name = project_name)
		
	INSERT INTO corrections (user_id, projects_id, score)
	VALUES (user_id, project_id, score);

END ##
```

## Example II
-  creates a stored procedure `ComputeAverageScoreForUser` that computes and store the average score for a student.
``` SQL
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ComputeAverageScoreForUser;
DELIMITER ##
CREATE PROCEDURE ComputeAverageScoreForUser(IN Id INT)
BEGIN
    UPDATE users
    SET average_score = (SELECT AVG(score) FROM corrections WHERE user_id = Id)
    WHERE users.id = Id;
END ##
DELIMITER ;
```
